"""Golden path: starting one <audio> item pauses another (#41), and the
Loop / Play All playback controls (#84).

This suite runs against a shared Preview database (matching
test_admin_about.py's own convention of cleaning up after itself), so two
different isolation strategies are used depending on what each test needs:

- test_starting_one_audio_pauses_another adds temporary audio items to the
  seeded demo song and removes them afterward. Media cards are located by
  their specific marker label (`has_text=`), never by position (`.nth()`)
  -- the demo song can carry other, unrelated media (real content the app
  owner uploaded while exploring the app, or a golden-path item from
  another spec), so a positional locator would silently pick up the wrong
  element. This works here because the assertions only ever evaluate the
  specific audio elements they located, never anything order-dependent.

- test_play_all_and_loop_sequence cannot use that approach: Play All starts
  the first item in the *entire currently-visible sequence*, and Loop's
  restart depends on which item is truly last -- both order-dependent
  across whatever else is visible. Filtering to a specific voice tag (#67)
  was tried as an isolation mechanism and failed live in CI, twice: first
  because the seed song carried other real media across all tags, then
  because filtering to voice "S" (AddMediaForm's default) still collided
  once real Soprano-tagged content existed too. A brand-new song, created
  and torn down entirely within the test, is the only isolation that holds
  regardless of what content exists elsewhere.

Fake same-origin .mp3 URLs (nonexistent paths on BASE_URL itself) are used
deliberately: detectMediaKind() only needs the URL to end in a recognized
audio extension to render a real <audio> element -- the underlying
resource never needs to actually load or even exist. Same-origin matters:
this suite may run in network-sandboxed environments where a real external
host's fetch can stall indefinitely rather than erroring quickly, and
`el.play()`'s returned Promise only resolves once playback actually
starts -- awaiting it (directly or via Locator.evaluate's own promise
handling) can hang far longer than any reasonable timeout if that fetch
never settles. `.play()` is therefore called fire-and-forget below (its
promise deliberately not returned/awaited): the native "play" event this
behavior depends on fires synchronously as part of the play() algorithm,
before the browser even knows whether the source is playable. Simulating
an item finishing (`dispatchEvent(new Event("ended"))`) is a plain
synchronous DOM event, not a Promise, so it needs no such care. Iframe-
embedded kinds (YouTube/Drive/SoundCloud) are a documented, untested
exception (see #41/#84) -- they can't be paused or sequenced cross-origin.
