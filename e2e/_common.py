"""Shared helpers for the Playwright E2E smoke suite.

Written against the Python `playwright` package (already present in the `ds`
conda env, browsers pre-cached) rather than `@playwright/test`, per project
convention of using `ds` for Python tooling instead of adding a parallel npm
dev-dependency. Run each spec directly, or all of them via `run.py`:

    conda run -n ds python e2e/run.py
    conda run -n ds python e2e/test_auth.py

BASE_URL defaults to local dev; CI overrides it to point at a server booted
against the Preview/Development Supabase project (see #52) — never
production. SEED_* creds match prisma/seed.ts exactly; if that file's demo
data changes, update these too.

Login is rate-limited (5 attempts per email per 15min, #20) — a real
production control, not something to raise just for tests. Specs that need
an authenticated session but aren't testing the login flow itself should use
admin_page()/chorister_page() (a cached, reused session shared across the
whole suite) rather than a fresh login() call each time. Running the full
suite twice in quick succession can still trip the limit (each run costs one
real admin login for test_auth.py's own login-flow test, plus whichever spec
happens to be the first admin_page() consumer) — if that happens locally,
either wait ~15 minutes or delete the relevant `RateLimitBucket` row
directly (not exposed as a helper here deliberately, to avoid the suite
routinely resetting a real security control on itself).

# any spec that isn't specifically testing the login flow itself should
# reuse a cached authenticated session instead of calling login() again.
# Cached at module scope: shared by every test_*.py file within one
# `run.py` process (or one `python e2e/test_x.py` process), so the whole
# suite only ever does one real admin login and one real chorister login
# via this path, regardless of how many specs need to be authenticated.
